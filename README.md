# Contra
------
Pathetic attempts to recreate the great game's features

Already done:
*  Shooting
*  Moving 
*  Dead 
*  Enemys
*  Enemy's dead
*  Enemy's damage
*  Player animations
*  Enemy's moving 
--------------
What to do next (i don't think so):
*  Level's
*  Shooting platform's (almost implemented)
